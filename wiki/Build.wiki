#summary How to build the project.

= Introduction =

Even if the source code is the same, the procedure to build the project differs depending on the target OS.

Supported OS are:
  * Windows (the target binary will be 32 bits)
  * Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
  * Mac OS X 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7

In all cases the result will be a dynamic linkable library.

The project contains a SVN external dependency to the last version of Unitex on University of Marne-la-Vallée SVN repository.

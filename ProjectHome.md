This project implements an Apache UIMA annotator based on the UIMA C++ 2.4.0 framework (http://http://uima.apache.org).

It encapsulates the Unitex linguistics analysis engine (http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~unitex/) based on local grammars.

It allows applying dictionaries and local grammars developped for Unitex using the GramLab IDELing (http://code.google.com/p/gramlab-ideling) on collections of documents to match complex expressions in natural language, and produce information about them.

This annotator was developped within the context of the GramLab European Project (http://www.gramlab.org).
